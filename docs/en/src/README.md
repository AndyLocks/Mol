This is an experimental project that connects chemistry with abstract mathematics through category theory. At its core lies an original model in which molecules and chemical reactions are represented as objects and morphisms in a multicategory.

The project offers:

* A formal description of chemical reactions as compositional transformations;
* A custom syntax for describing molecules, reactions, and reaction chains;
* A server-side API for analyzing, storing, and searching reaction pathways;
* A possible foundation for synthesis simulation, automatic product derivation, and reaction network visualization.

Why might this be interesting?

* For mathematicians: a living example of applying categorical thinking to natural science.
* For chemists: a tool for analyzing and formalizing reactions without losing chemical meaning.
* For programmers: a clean, extensible project at the intersection of language, graphs, and algebra.
